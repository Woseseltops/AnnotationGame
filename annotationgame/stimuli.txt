I enter a lovely huge room where lots of people are. I walk past a long dining table toward a second room where I'm told there are Dee Dee's rich Uncle's glass bell scales. I look in and the room is filled with beautiful glass objects. We're not supposed to go in yet. So I see Dee and decide to go sit by her since she has a rich Uncle. I pass up a wooden high chair and sit on a wooden dining chair. I remember she was always refined and smart, so I guess it shouldn't be a surprise that she has a rich Uncle. Later I decide to choose a room and at first go to a plain room out of habit. Then I say, "Wait." I look around. I mentally review all the rooms and, since I don't see any I like, I envision one I'd like to be there. It's all glass, a balcony and it has beautiful glass and crystal objects that shine rainbows like a prism all over the room. I use this room to write in because I become mesmerized by the lovely rainbows printing about the room, and I go into a trance, so my writing comes up straight from the subconscious.	1
